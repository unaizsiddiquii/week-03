//7. Counting Sort - Sort Student Ages
//Problem Statement:
//A school collects studentsâ€™ ages (ranging from 10 to 18) and wants them sorted. Implement Counting Sort for this task.
//        Hint:
//Create a count array to store the frequency of each age.
//Compute cumulative frequencies to determine positions.
//Place elements in their correct positions in the output array.
